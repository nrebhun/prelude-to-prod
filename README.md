```
Do not go gentle into that good prod,
Old bugs should burn and rave at close of day;
Merge, merge against the dying of the light.

Though wise devs at their end know dark is right,
Because their code had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good prod.

Good devs, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green build,
Merge, merge against the dying of the light.

Wild devs who caught and sang the datum in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good prod.

Grave devs, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Merge, merge against the dying of the light.

And you, my architect, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good prod.
Merge, merge against the dying of the light.
```
